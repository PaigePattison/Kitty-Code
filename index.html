  <p><img src="cola.jpg" alt="image of brown cat" class="colaimg"> Cola is a male cat who was found abandoned and living in a waste land unfortunately his owners could not
    be tracked down. He was in a bad condition suffering with skin conditions from mites. He had hardly any hair
    and his skin was red raw. We took him for medical care at the PDSA, there we discovered he had also been suffering
    from a bacterial infection which added to his poor skin condition. After plenty of care and a few baths his hair
    started to grow and we approriately named him Cola. Cola is a friendly 5 yr old cat who loves attention. He is looking
    for a loving family ideally with no other pets. If you're interested in adopting Cola, click the link to apply. </p>

  <p> Oliver is a 6 month old playful kitty. He was brought to us from his owner who was unable to pay for his
    medical bills. Oliver suffers with a rare eye condition which affects his sight. He is sensitive to light
    and his eyes need cleaning atleast twice a day to prevent further eye sight problems. Oliver is very happy
    and abit dopey, he constantly bumps into objects and falls from furniture. Luckily he takes this in his stride
    and loves life regardless. He is an indoor cat and can live with children and other pets. If you can provide a
    loving home for Oliver then click the link to apply. </p>

  <p> Agatha is a female ferrel cat, she was taken in and domesticated by her late owners who have Unfortunately
    passed. Our MEOW team were called by concerned neighbous who told us this sad story and described Agatha's weight
    loss and despression. Since being at MEOW our team have found she is suffering with grief and have tried to help
    her cope. After a few months she has begun to spend more time with other people and is now ready to find another
    warm and caring home. She struggles to build bonds with people and therefore needs to be rehomed with a patient
    and committed owner. If you feel you have the right qualities to match Agatha then click the link to apply. </p>

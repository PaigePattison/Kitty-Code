  <p> Cola is a male cat who was found abandoned and living in a waste land.
    Unfortunately his owners could not be tracked down. He was in a bad condition suffering with
    skin conditions from mites. He had hardly any hair and his skin was red raw. We took him for
    medical care at the PDSA, there we discovered he had also been suffering from a bacterial infection
    which added to his poor skin condition. After plenty of care and a few baths his hair started to grow
    and we approriately named him Cola. Cola is a friendly 5 yr old cat who loves attention. He is looking
    for a loving family ideally with no other pets. If you're interested in adopting Cola, click the link

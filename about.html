    <p> by MEOW was founded by two young women who were initially developing their coding skills.
      When researching further for a coding course they stumbled across a very important issue, the
      amount of cats who are in need of homes. Cats Protection estimates that there are nine million
      stray cats and one-and-a-half million feral cats in the UK. The most vunerable of cats are often
      older cats or cats with medical difficulties. We decided to create a website where by our
      organisation could help to care for the most vunerable cats and find them new homes. Currently
      in the UK 44% of homes own pets. We at MEOW hope to increase that number and help match our Cats
      to their owners. </p>

      <p> Our policy includes an apllication and a fee. This is standard proceedure for the following reasons
      <ol >
      <li>  Many cruel people obtain free animals for the purposes of entertaiment and violence.</a></li>
      <li>  Not all pet owners are aware of the committments required to care for a pet.</a></li>
      <li>  Some of the cats we care for have extra needs and require patient and caring owners.</a></li>
    </ol>
